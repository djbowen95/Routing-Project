# Routing Project in Express
This will be a simple Node application with Express routing. It is built with starter code - but I will be adding additional routes, for a 404 page and for providing users diagnostic information. It will be deployed to Amazon Web Services with EC2.

## About the Project
This was a mini-project assignment for the [University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926). To see the given project brief, click [here](./docs/brief.md).

I'd built a version of this project before in class locally while enrolled in the course - but decided to repeat this project as I wanted something simple to deploy as my first project to AWS' EC2. I also think it will be useful to have a version uploaded on GitHub, to demonstrate my fundamental skills in Express and Node.

## Usage
1. Deployed Link
2. 404 Page
3. Diagnostics

## Features
1. Technology Stack - Node with Express (or 1. Node, 2. Express)
2. Routing (GET/POST)
3. Fetch API
4. Middleware and Helpers?
5. AWS EC2

## Version History

## Testing
I did not build this application with testing. I have built some Node projects with unit testing and test-driven development principles, which you can view [here](https://github.com/djbowen95/Team-Profile-Builder) and [here](https://github.com/djbowen95/GuessingGame). I do intend to built unit tests for this project at some point - but have not set a deadline at the moment for this.
## Contribution
This is a small portfolio project and I am not particularly looking to collaborate. I am really open to working together on other projects in Node or Express with other junior developers though. Please use some of the contact details below if you are interested in working together on something!
